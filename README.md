# MazeSolver

MazeSolver is a web-based application that visualizes maze-solving algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to interactively generate and solve mazes.

## Features
- **Maze Generation**: Randomly generates mazes of different sizes.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Implements BFS and DFS for solving the maze.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to manually set start and end points.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Visual representation of the algorithm solving the maze.
- **Reset & Replay**: Users can reset and run the simulation again.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aman-Kumar778/MazeSolver.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd MazeSolver
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage
1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Click the "Generate Maze" button to create a new maze.
3. Select an algorithm (BFS or DFS) to solve the maze.
4. Watch the step-by-step visualization.
5. Reset and try different maze configurations.
